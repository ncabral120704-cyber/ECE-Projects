# ECE-Projects
Embedded systems and microcontroller projects using PIC32, peripherals, interrupts and digital/analog circuits.

This repository contains a collection of electrical engineering projects
completed as part of my coursework and independent work. The projects focus on
embedded systems, microcontroller programming, and digital and analog circuit
design.

## Tools & Technologies
- PIC32 Microcontrollers
- Embedded C
- MPLAB X IDE
- Timers, interrupts, GPIO
- Peripheral Pin Select (PPS)
- Digital and analog circuit analysis

## Projects
Each folder in this repository represents a standalone project and includes:
- A brief project description (README)
- Source code files
- Key concepts and takeaways

Highlighted projects include:
- **Piezo Buzzer Alarm Timer** – Timer- and interrupt-based countdown system with seven-segment display output
- **PPS Rotary Encoder** – Peripheral Pin Select configuration with interrupt-driven encoder input

## About Me
I am an Electrical Engineering student with a strong interest in embedded
systems and microcontroller-based design. This repository serves as a technical
portfolio to showcase my hands-on project experience.
